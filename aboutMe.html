		<section class="song">
			"11:59" <br><br>

			It's eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine seconds. <br>
			If I'm gonna die tonight I want heaven, ay, ay, with you. [x2] <br>
			<br>
			It was eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine clicks. <br>
			The whole world's burning but the clock just ticks<br>
			over and over, every single day. <br>
			Some people steal while other people pray<br>
			to God, to man, machines or whatever. <br>
			Some of us just lost faith altogether. <br>
			"No way," they say, "it can't be this way."<br> 
			That's why so many people stand up and say:<br>
			<br>
			One love, one blood, one heart, one soul and <br>
			one drum and only one rhythm,<br>
			One tribe and all of us singing. <br>
			<br>
			It's eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine seconds. <br>
			If I'm gonna die tonight I want heaven, ay, ay, with you. [x2]<br>
			<br>
			It was eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine clicks. <br>
			Life's a cord plugged in, the whole world's sick.<br>
			Got diseases excited, they crawled up inside us. <br>
			Superstupiditis, philosophies that divide us. <br>
			Keep us in fear from one another <br>
			so we can't recognize a brother from another mother. <br>
			No way, we can't live this way, <br>
			that's why so many people stand up and say:<br>
			<br>
			One love, one blood, one heart, one soul and <br>
			one drum and only one rhythm,<br>
			One tribe and all of us singing. <br>
			<br>
			It's eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine seconds. <br>
			If I'm gonna die tonight I want heaven, ay, ay, with you. [x2] <br>
			<br>
			(I wanna rock it with you)<br>
			Ay, I wanna rock it with you,<br>
			I wanna rock it with you,<br>
			Till the day I die, till the day I die,<br>
			I wanna rock with you, till the day I die.<br>
			<br>
			It was eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine clicks. <br>
			The whole world's burning, but the clock just ticks.<br> 
			Some people cry, others occupy,<br>
			throw your hands high as the bullets fly by.<br>
			I dry my eyes, others wonder why,<br>
			but I just wanna be with you till the day I die <br>
			<br>
			One love, one blood, one heart, one soul and <br>
			one drum and only one rhythm, <br>
			One tribe and all of us singing.<br>
			<br>
			It's eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine seconds. <br>
			If I'm gonna die tonight I want heaven, ay, ay, with you. [x4]<br>
