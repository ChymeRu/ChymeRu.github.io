			"11:59" <br><br>

		It's eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine seconds. <br>
		If I'm gonna die tonight I want heaven, ay, ay, with you. [x2] <br>
<br>
It was eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine clicks. <br>
The whole world's burning but the clock just ticks<br>
over and over, every single day. <br>
Some people steal while other people pray<br>
to God, to man, machines or whatever. <br>
Some of us just lost faith altogether. <br>
"No way," they say, "it can't be this way."<br> 
That's why so many people stand up and say:<br>
<br>
One love, one blood, one heart, one soul and <br>
one drum and only one rhythm,<br>
One tribe and all of us singing. <br>
<br>
It's eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine seconds. <br>
If I'm gonna die tonight I want heaven, ay, ay, with you. [x2]<br>
<br>
It was eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine clicks. <br>
Life's a cord plugged in, the whole world's sick.<br>
Got diseases excited, they crawled up inside us. <br>
Superstupiditis, philosophies that divide us. <br>
Keep us in fear from one another <br>
so we can't recognize a brother from another mother. <br>
No way, we can't live this way, <br>
that's why so many people stand up and say:<br>
<br>
One love, one blood, one heart, one soul and <br>
one drum and only one rhythm,<br>
One tribe and all of us singing. <br>
<br>
It's eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine seconds. <br>
If I'm gonna die tonight I want heaven, ay, ay, with you. [x2] <br>
<br>
(I wanna rock it with you)<br>
Ay, I wanna rock it with you,<br>
I wanna rock it with you,<br>
Till the day I die, till the day I die,<br>
I wanna rock with you, till the day I die.<br>
<br>
It was eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine clicks. <br>
The whole world's burning, but the clock just ticks.<br> 
Some people cry, others occupy,<br>
throw your hands high as the bullets fly by.<br>
I dry my eyes, others wonder why,<br>
but I just wanna be with you till the day I die <br>
<br>
One love, one blood, one heart, one soul and <br>
one drum and only one rhythm, <br>
One tribe and all of us singing.<br>
<br>
It's eleven fifty-nine and fifty-nine seconds. <br>
If I'm gonna die tonight I want heaven, ay, ay, with you. [x4]<br>
